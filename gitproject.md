# Keylogger project.

### Our team has two students, **Mink and Olu**.

The topic of our project is a python project building a _keylogger_. Keylogger is a security tool that **_records the keys entered on the keyboard on a computer_**. Keyloggers can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes.

We will use **Github** and **python** for this project. 1. Github is a web based platform that _tracks and backs up_ our work. We will use python to build the code.

- This is the resource of our project.
